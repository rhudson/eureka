###Eureka Client configuration for Sample Eureka Client

# see the README in eureka-examples to see an overview of the example set up

# note that for a purely client usage (e.g. only used to get information about other services,
# there is no need for registration. This property applies to the singleton DiscoveryClient so
# if you run a server that is both a service provider and also a service consumer,
# then don't set this property to false.
eureka.registration.enabled=false

## configuration related to reaching the eureka servers
eureka.preferSameZone=true
eureka.shouldUseDns=false
eureka.serviceUrl.default=http://localhost:8080/eureka/v2/

eureka.decoderName=JacksonJson

# This requires a hack in the code to use the experimental version of the JerseyEurekaHttpClientFactoryBuilder
# The legacy builder does not respect the proxy server settings.
eureka.eurekaServer.proxyHost=localhost
eureka.eurekaServer.proxyPort=8880
